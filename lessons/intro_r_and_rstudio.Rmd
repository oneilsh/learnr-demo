## R and RStudio

We mentioned in the last section that R is an interpreted language, meaning that files containing R code are read, or interpreted, by another program. Since you are working with an interactive document over the web, the interpreter is actually running behind the scenes on a server. Try running some code:

```{r interp, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 3 * 4
x
```

What just happened? Your web browser sent those lines of code to a remote server, and that server passed them to the R interpreter for interpretation; the resulting answer was collected, and shipped back the browser to be displayed. 

While this will be a convenient way to learn about R, it's not the *usual* way we write and run code.
